# Description
## The Sun is 2.3*10^4 ly (light-years) away from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. For this example
## we will approximate its movement around the galaxy's center as a circle. Its speed during its circular
## movement is 250 km/s. (a) How long does it take the Sun to make one revolution about the galactic center?
## (b) How many revolutions has the Sun completed during the last 3.5*10^8 years?
