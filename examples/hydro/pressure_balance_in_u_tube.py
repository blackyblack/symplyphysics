# Description
## A U-tube contains two liquids at static equilibrium:
## 1) water of density rho_water = 998 kg/m^3 in the right arm and
## 2) oil of unknown density rho_oil in the left.
## The distance between the oil-water interface and the end of the water column is 135 mm.
## The oil column is 12.3 mm higher than the water column.
## Find the density of the oil.
