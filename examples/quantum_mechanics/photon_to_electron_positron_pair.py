# Description
## Can a free photon with enough energy turn into an electron-positron pair?

# First of all, the conversion of a photon into an electron-positron pair is only possible
# in the presence of another particle, otherwise the process would violate the law of conservation
# of momentum. Next, the more the mass of the third particle is, the less kinetic energy it gets
# after the conversion, and we can omit its kinetic energy out of the equation.

# If the electron and positron are at rest after their creation, their total energy would be the lowest
# out of all possible values and be equal to the rest energy of the system.

# TODO: make law for this
# This equation describes the threshold (i.e. minimum) energy the photon must have to be able
# to be converted into an electron-positron pair.
