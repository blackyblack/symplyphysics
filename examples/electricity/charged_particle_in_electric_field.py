# Description
## A charged drop with a mass of m = 1.5e-7 g and a negative charge of magnitude Q = 2.8e-13 C enters
## the region between two plates, initially moving along the x axis with speed 20 m/s. The plates
## are wholly located in parallel to the xOz plane. The length of each plate along the x axis is 1.6 cm.
## The plates are charged and produce a uniform, downward directed (y being the vertical axis) electric
## field at all points between them. The electric field's magnitude is 1.1e6 N/C. What is the vertical
## deflection of the drop at the far edge of the plates? Neglect the gravitational force on the drop
## since the drop is small enough that the electrostatic force prevails over the gravitational one.
