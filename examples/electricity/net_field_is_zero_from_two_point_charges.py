# Description
## Two charged particles are fixed to an x-axis. Particle 1 of charge q1 = 2.1*10^-8 C is at position x = 20 cm;
## particle 2 of charge q2 = -4.0*q1 is at position x = 70 cm. Find the coordinate on the axis other than the
## infinity at which the net electric field produced by the two particles equals zero?
