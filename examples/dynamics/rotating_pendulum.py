# Description
## A physical pendulum consisting of a ball fixed on the end of a thin rigid rod can freely
## oscillate around the horizontal axis A passing through the upper end of the rod. Axis A
## is fixed rigidly on the geometric axis B of a horizontal disk uniformly rotating around
## axis B with angular velocity `w`. Thus, the plane of oscillation of the pendulum rotates
## together with the disk with the same angular velocity `w`. Find the period of small
## oscillations of the pendulum if the mass of the rod is negligible compared to the mass
## of the ball. Under what condition will the lower vertical position of the rod become an
## unstable equilibrium position?

# Solving the problem in the non-inertial reference frame fixed to the plane in which the
# pendulum oscillates.
