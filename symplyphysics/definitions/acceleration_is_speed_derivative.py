Acceleration is speed derivative
================================

*Acceleration* describes how quickly speed changes with time.

**Conditions:**

#. Speed must be differentiable with respect to time on the interval of interest.
#. Non-relativistic motion, i.e. speed of a body is much less than the speed of light and space-time curvature is negligible.

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia â€“ Instantaneous acceleration <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration#Instantaneous_acceleration>`__
