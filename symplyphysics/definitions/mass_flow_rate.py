Mass flow rate
==============

The *mass flow rate* of a system is the time derivative of its mass. Typical
examples include fluid passing through a pipe section or fuel being burned.

**Conditions:**

#. Mass is a continuous, differentiable function of time.

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia â€“ Formulation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_flow_rate#Formulation>`__
