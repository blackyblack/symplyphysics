Compressibility factor is deviation from ideal gas
==================================================

The **compressibility factor** (also called the **compression factor** or **gas deviation factor**) quantifies how far a real gas departs from ideal-gas behaviour.

**Notation:**

#. :quantity_notation:`molar_gas_constant`.

**Conditions:**

#. Temperature is strictly greater than zero.
#. Amount of substance, pressure, and volume are all finite and non-zero.
#. The gas sample is at thermodynamic equilibrium.

**Notes:**

#. Can be equivalently defined as the ratio of the molar volume :math:`V/n` of the real gas to the molar volume :math:`RT/\\rho` of the corresponding ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure.
#. :math:`Z = 1` corresponds to ideal-gas behaviour.
#. At high pressures repulsive interactions dominate, giving :math:`Z > 1`.
#. At low pressures attractive interactions dominate, giving :math:`Z < 1`.
