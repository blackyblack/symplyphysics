# Description
## The thermal resistance to conduction is a physical quantity that was introduced in the engineering
## practice for insulators: greater values of thermal resistance mean better insulation properties of
## a material of given thickness.

# Definition: R = L/k
## R - thermal resistance to conduction, also known as R-value
## L - thickness of slab
## k - thermal conductivity of material
