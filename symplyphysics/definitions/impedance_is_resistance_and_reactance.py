"""
Impedance is resistance and reactance
=====================================

*Impedance* combines a circuit's resistance (real part) and reactance (imaginary part) into a
single complex quantity. The definition applies at a specific angular frequency and is used
for steady-state AC analysis.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`i` is the imaginary unit.

**Conditions:**

#. Linear, time-invariant circuit operating in steady-state with sinusoidal excitation.
#. Resistance and reactance are evaluated at the same angular frequency.
