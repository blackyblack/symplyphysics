"""
Impedance is resistance and reactance
=====================================

*Impedance* is the combination of resistance and reactance (both inductive and capacitive) and is
a complex number, containing both real and imaginary parts. The real part of impedance is
resistance, and the imaginary part is reactance.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`i` is the imaginary unit.
