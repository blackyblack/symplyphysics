    """
    **Divergence** is a differential operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar
    field that gives the rate that the vector field alters the volume in an infinitesimal
    neighborhood at each point. In physical terms, it is the extent to which the vector field
    behaves like a source or a sink at each point.

    In an arbitrary curvilinear orthogonal coordinate system with base scalars `{q_i}` and Lam√©
    coefficients `{h_i}`, the gradient of `F({q_i})` can be calculated as follows::

        div(F) = sum(diff(F_i * J / h_i, q_i), i) / J

    Here, `diff` is the differentiation operator, and `J = h_1 * h_2 * h_3` is the Jacobian
    determinant.
