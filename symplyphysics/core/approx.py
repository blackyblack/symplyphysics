"""
This module provides the functionality for checking and asserting that two numbers, quantities or
quantity vectors are equal to each other within some tolerance.

* `approx_equal_numbers` checks if two numbers are equal.
* `approx_equal_quantities` checks if two quantities are equal.
* `assert_equal` asserts that two quantities are equal.
* `assert_equal_vectors` asserts that two quantity vectors are equal.
