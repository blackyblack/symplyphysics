Time is a scalar physical quantity operationally defined as the reading of a clock, specifically
a count of repeating events such as the SI second. It is a fundamental concept used to define other
physical quantities.

"""
Mass is an intrinsic scalar property of a body, and one can distinguish at least seven different aspects
of mass that define it. Experiments have shown that these values are proportional, and in some cases
equal. Often, the inertial mass is being used, which is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration
when a force is applied.
