# Description
## In a gas, the free path length of charged particles is small and the particles, as they move, experience many collisions in the
## volume between the electrodes. In this case, the speed of directional movement will depend not on the potential difference traveled,
## but on the local value of the electric intensity.

## Law is: v = b0 * E / p, where
## v - the velocity of the directional motion of charged particles in a gas,
## b0 - mobility of charged particles at a single pressure,
## E - electric intensity,
## p - pressure.
