# Description
## The atoms of the target material evaporate and move towards the substrate inside the magnetron. At the same time,
## it collides with gas atoms. The free path length is the distance that a traveling atom travels between two collisions.

## Law is: l = k * T / (sqrt(2) * P * sigma), where
## l - free path length of traveling atom,
## k - boltzmann constant,
## T - temperature,
## P - pressure,
## sigma - the cross section of the interaction of a traveling atom and a gas atom.

# Notes
## Assuming the model of spherical gas molecules, `sigma = pi * d**2` where `d` is the molecule diameter.
