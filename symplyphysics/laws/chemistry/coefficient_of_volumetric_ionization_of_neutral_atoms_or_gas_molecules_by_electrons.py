# Description
## At a certain voltage, the gas discharge becomes independent. To find this voltage, it is necessary to know the volumetric ionization coefficient.
## And it, in turn, depends on the energy distribution of electrons and can be approximated by the expression below.

## Law is: a = A * p * exp(-B * p / E), where
## a - volumetric ionization coefficient,
## A - the first constant of gas,
## p - pressure,
## B - the second constant of gas,
## E - electric intensity.
