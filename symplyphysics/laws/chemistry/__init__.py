Chemistry is a physical science that studies the chemical elements that make up matter and
compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties,
behavior and the changes they undergo during reactions with other substances.

**Effective cross section**

The effective cross section is a physical quantity characterizing the probability of transition of
a system of two interacting particles to a certain final state, a quantitative characteristic of
the acts of collision of particles of a stream hitting a target with target particles. The
effective cross-section has the dimension of the area.
