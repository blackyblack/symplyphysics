# Description
## Hard spheres are widely used as model particles in the statistical mechanical theory, defined as
## impenetrable spheres that cannot overlap in space, which mimics extremely strong repulsion that
## atoms and molecules experience at very close distances

# Law: U(r) = infinity if r <= sigma else 0
## U - hard spheres potential
## r - distance between particles
## sigma - diameter of sphere
