# Description
## Faraday's first law of electrolysis: the mass of a substance deposited on an electrode during electrolysis
## is directly proportional to the amount of electricity transferred to this electrode. By the amount of
## electricity, we mean the total electric charge that has passed through the surface of the electrode.

## Law is: m = k * I * t, where
## m - mass,
## k - electrochemical equivalent,
## I - current,
## t - time.
