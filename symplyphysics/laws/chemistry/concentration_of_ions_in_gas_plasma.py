# Description
## A gasâ€“discharge plasma is an ionized gas in which the concentrations of positively and negatively charged particles are approximately
## equal to each other, and the Debye shielding radius is significantly smaller than the characteristic size of the volume in which the
## ionized gas is located.
## A probe is an auxiliary metal electrode that is inserted into a plasma volume for its examination. Flat, cylindrical and spherical probes
## are used. A potential is set relative to one of the electrodes on the probe and the dependence of the incoming current on the value of
## this potential is removed.
## By measuring the probe current, the concentration of ions in the plasma can be determined.

## Law is: n = I0 / (S * e * sqrt(k * T / (2 * pi * m))), where
## n - concentration of ions in plasma,
## I - probe current (at a probe potential equal to the plasma potential),
## S - probe surface area,
## e - elementary charge,
## k - boltzmann constant,
## T - temperature of electrons in plasma,
## m - electron rest mass.
