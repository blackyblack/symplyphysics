# Description
## Angular frequency "Ï‰" (also referred to by the terms angular speed and angular rate) is a scalar measure of the angular displacement per unit time.

# Law: w = N / t
# Where:
## N is radians per time,
## t is time,
## w is angular frequency.

time = Symbol("period", units.time)
# This is equivalent to frequency, but radians per second is a common notation for angular frequency

# Derive the same law from temporal frequency definition
