# Description
## Let's say we throw the body at an angle to the horizon with some initial velocity.
## Then the time of movement (time of fall) of the body will depend only on the initial velocity,
## the angle of the throw and the acceleration of free fall.
## The angle of the throw is the angle between the initial velocity vector and the horizontal axis.

## Law is: t = 2 * v0 * sin(a) / g, where
## t - movement time,
## v0 - initial velocity,
## a - angle of throw,
## g - acceleration of free fall.

# This law might be derived via "constant_acceleration_movement_is_parabolic" law

# so the angle is represented as a "pi/2 - angle".
