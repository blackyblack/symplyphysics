"""
Gravitational radius of massive body
====================================

The **gravitational radius**, or **Schwarzschild radius**, is a characteristic radius
defined for any physical body with mass. This is the radius of the sphere on which the
event horizon created by this mass would be located (from the point of view of general
theory of relativity) if it were distributed spherically symmetrically, would be
stationary (in particular, it would not rotate, but radial movements are permissible)
and would lie entirely inside this sphere.

**Notation:**

#. :quantity_notation:`gravitational_constant`.

#. :quantity_notation:`speed_of_light`.
