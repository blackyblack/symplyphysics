Second escape velocity
======================

The second cosmic velocity is the lowest velocity that must be given to an object starting from the surface of
a celestial body, the mass of which is negligible compared to the mass of a celestial body, in order to overcome
the gravitational attraction of this celestial body and leave a closed orbit around it.
