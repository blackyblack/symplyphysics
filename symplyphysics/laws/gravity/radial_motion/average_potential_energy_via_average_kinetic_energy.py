Average potential energy via average kinetic energy
===================================================

The average potential energy of an orbiting planet is directly proportional to its average
kinetic energy. The average of both energies is taken w.r.t. time.

**Conditions:**

#. Works for elliptical orbits, in which case the total energy :math:`E` of the planet is negative.
