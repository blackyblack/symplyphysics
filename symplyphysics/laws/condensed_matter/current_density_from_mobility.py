# Description
## Current density is the amount of charge per unit time that flows through a unit area of a chosen
## cross section. The current density vector is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the electric
## current per cross-sectional area at a given point in space, its direction being that of the motion
## of the positive charges at this point. In SI base units, the electric current density is measured
## in amperes per square metre.
## Mobility - characterises how quickly an electron or hole can move through a metal or semiconductor
## when pulled by an electric fiel.

## Law is: j = q * (-n1 * u1 + n2 * u2) * E, where
## j - current density of charge carriers,
## q - electron charge modulus,
## n1 - concentration of electrons,
## n2 - concentration of holes,
## u1 - mobility of electrons,
## u2 - mobility of holes,
## E - electric intensity (physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles).
