# Description
## Drift velocity is the average velocity attained by charged particles, such as electrons,
## in a material due to an electric field. In general, an electron in a conductor will propagate
## randomly at the Fermi velocity, resulting in an average velocity of zero. Applying an electric
## field adds to this random motion a small net flow in one direction; this is the drift.
## Mobility - characterises how quickly an electron or hole can move through a metal or semiconductor
## when pulled by an electric field.

## Law is: v = u * E, where
## v - drift velocity of charge carriers (electrons or holes),
## u - mobility of charge carriers (electrons or holes),
## E - electric field intensity.
