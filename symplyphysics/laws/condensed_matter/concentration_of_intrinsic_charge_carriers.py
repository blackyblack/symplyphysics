Concentration of intrinsic charge carriers
==========================================

In the absence of external influences (lighting, electric field, etc.), there is a
nonzero concentration of free charge carriers in the semiconductor.

**Notation:**

#. :quantity_notation:`boltzmann_constant`.

**Links:**

#. `Intrinsic carrier concentration <https://www.universitywafer.com/intrinsic-carrier-concentration.html>`_.

**Conditions:**

#. There are no external influences, such as lighting, electric field, etc.
