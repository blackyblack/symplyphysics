# Description
## Let us consider two inertial reference frames `S` (lab frame) and `S'` (proper frame). The proper frame moves
## with speed `v` relative to the lab frame. Both frames contain identical fixed (relative to their own frame)
## clocks that are synchronized according to the [Einstein rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_synchronisation).
## Let `x, y, z, t` be the coordinates and time of some event in frame `S`, and `x', y', z', t'` be the coordinates
## and time of the same event in frame `S'`. Assuming that the space is uniform and isotropic and that the time is
## uniform, there exists a linear dependence between `x, y, z, t` and `x', y', z', t'`, which is called the Lorentz
## transformation of space and time.

# Law: t' = (t - (V * x) / c**2) / sqrt(1 - (V / c)**2)
## t' - time in proper (S') reference frame
## t - time in lab (S) reference frame
## x - position in lab (S) reference frame
## V - speed of proper (S') frame relative to lab (S) frame
## c - speed of light

# Conditions
## - Space is uniform and isotropic.
## - Time is uniform.
## - The relative frame velocity is parallel to the `x` axis.

# Notes
## - Lab frame S is usually thought as stationary, and proper frame S' is the one that is considered to be moving
##   relative to lab frame and the moving object in question is at rest in the proper frame.
## - In this law, the Lorentz transformation from the lab frame `S` into the proper frame `S'` is described. In order to get
##   an opposite transformation (from the proper frame `S'` into the lab frame `S`), replace all primed variables with unprimed
##   ones and vice verce, and replace `V` with `-V`. This is consistent with the fact that frame `S` can be viewed as moving
##   with speed `-V` relative to frame `S'`, and hence the same Lorentz transformation can be applied.
## - In the limit of `V/c << 1` the formula reduces to the classical Galilean transformation `t' = t`.
