#TODO: add transverse Doppler effect with angle

# Description
## Doppler effect is also applicable to electromagnetic waves in vacuum. As there is no any medium required for these waves to propagate,
## speed of source related to observer is used for the calculation of the Doppler effect.

# Law: fo = fs * sqrt((c - v)/(c + v)), where
## fo is observed frequency,
## fs is source wave frequency,
## v is relative velocity of source and observer (positive when moving away from each other, negative when moving towards each other),
## c is speed of light.

# Conditions:
## - Source and observer are moving directly towards or away from each other.
## - Wave speed is close to speed of light. It means this law is only applicable to electromagnetic waves.

# Note:
## When direction of source and observer is not directed towards to/away from each other, one should introduce angle to the formula to
## obtain transverse Doppler effect (TDE) formula.

# Note:
## This is a special case, when wave speed in medium (vacuum) is close to speed of light. But relativistic version of classical
## Doppler effect is more general case, that includes non-electromagnetic waves.
