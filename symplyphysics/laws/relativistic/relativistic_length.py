# Description
# Length contraction is the phenomenon that a moving object's length is
# measured to be shorter than its proper length, which is the length as
# measured in the object's own rest frame.
# Law: l_rel = l * sqrt(1 - v**2 / c**2), where
# l is rest length,
# v is velocity,
# c is speed of light,
# l_rel is relativistic length.
