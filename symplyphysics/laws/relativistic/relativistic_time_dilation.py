# Description
# Time dilation is the difference in elapsed time as measured by two clocks,
# either due to a relative velocity between them (special relativity),
# or a difference in gravitational potential between their locations
# (general relativity).
# Law: t_rel = t / sqrt(1 - v**2 / c**2), where
# t_rel is time that has passed as measured by a stationary observer (relative time),
# t is time that has passed as measured by the traveling observer,
# v is velocity,
# c is speed of light.
