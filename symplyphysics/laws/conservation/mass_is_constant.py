# Description
## The mass is constant in a system that is closed, and mass is not transformed to energy

# Law: dm/dt = 0
## Where:
## m - summary mass of a system,
## t - time,
## dm/dt - mass derivative over time.

# Conditions:
## - System in a closed impenetrable volume, that is, molecules/atoms cannot leave it
##   and they are always inside;
## - Mass is not transformed to energy, for example due to annihilation.

# Note:
## SymPy does not have a proper way to represent constant mass. We use it's derivative over time instead. Derivative
## of the constant value is zero.
