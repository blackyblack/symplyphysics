# Description
## The mass of a mixture of liquids (gases) is equal to the sum of the masses of the components of the mixture
## sum(m_i) = m
## Where:
## m_i - mass of mixture component
## m - mass of mixture
##
# Conditions:
## - Mixture in a closed impenetrable volume, that is, molecules/atoms cannot leave it
##   and they are always inside;
## - Mass is not transformed to energy, for example due to annihilation.
