# Description
## Mechanical energy, sum of the kinetic energy, or energy of motion, and the potential energy, or energy stored in a system by
## reason of the position of its parts.
## Mechanical energy is constant in a system that has only gravitational forces or in an otherwise idealized system â€” that is,
## one lacking dissipative forces, such as friction and air resistance, or one in which such forces can be reasonably neglected.

# Law: dE/dt = 0
## Where:
## E - summary mechanical energy of a system,
## t - time,
## dE/dt - energy derivative over time.

# Note:
## SymPy does not have a proper way to represent constant energy. We use it's derivative over time instead. Derivative
## of the constant value is zero.
