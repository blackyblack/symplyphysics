"""
Radiance of black body from temperature
=======================================

The Stefanâ€”Boltzmann law, also known as Stefan's law, states that the total energy radiated per
unit surface area of a black body per unit time is directly proportional to the fourth
power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature.

**Notation:**

#. :quantity_notation:`stefan_boltzmann_constant`.

**Conditions:**

#. The body is completely black, i.e. it absorbs all energy.

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law>`__.
