# Description
## The heat of vaporization of a substance is the amount of heat that must be communicated
# to a substance at constant pressure and temperature in order to transfer
# it from a liquid state to a gaseous state (into steam).
## Q = k_v * m
## Where:
## Q - the energy required to convert a substance from a liquid to a gaseous state
## k_v - the specific heat of vaporization is the necessary energy that must be communicated
## to a substance weighing 1 kg in order to convert it to a gaseous state
##
## NOTICE: This law is similar to the law of energy released during
## the combustion of matter. Mathematically, they are similar,
## but different in terms of physical meaning. In the law of melting energy,
## the specific heat of melting is the amount of heat needed to melt
## a solid material weighing 1 kg. In the law of energy released during combustion,
## the specific heat of combustion is the amount of heat released during
## the complete combustion of a substance weighing 1 kg.
## In the law of energy for vaporization, the specific heat of vaporization is the amount of energy
## must be expended to evaporate one kilogram of a substance taken at boiling point.
