# Description
## The first law of thermodynamics is a formulation of the law of conservation of energy in the
## context of thermodynamic processes. It relates the change in internal energe of the system,
## work done on or by the system and the amount of heat supplied to or widthrawn from the system
## during a thermodynamic process.

# Law: dU = delta Q - delta W
## dU - infinitesimal change in internal energy of system
## delta Q - inexact differential of an infinitesimal amount of heat supplied to
##           or withdrawn from the system during the interaction with its surroundings
## delta W - inexact differential of infinitesimal work done by the system

# Note
## - Work done _by_ the system is positive, whereas work done _on_ the system by the environment
##   is negative.
## - Amount of heat flowing from the environment _into_ the system is positive, whereas amount of
##   heat flowing into the environment _out of_ the system is negative.
## - This formula can be extended to finite processes, with the only difference being that the
##   changes are not infinitesimal but finite (`dU` would refer to a finite change in the system's
##   internal energy, delta Q would be the total amount of heat supplied and delta W would be the total
##   work done by the system).

# Conditions
## - This formula applies to any infinitesimal thermodynamic process, be it (quasi)static or not.
