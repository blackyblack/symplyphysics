**Heat transfer**
=================

Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the generation, use,
conversion, and exchange of thermal energy (heat) between physical systems. Heat transfer
is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection,
thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes.
