"""
Heat is heat capacity times temperature change
==============================================

The amount of heat a body receives or releases when its temperature changes is equal
to the heat capacity of the body times the change in the body's temperature.

**Notes:**

#. Usually intensive heat capacity is known, in that case refer to :doc:`laws.quantities` laws.

**Condition:**

#. The heat capacity must be independent of the body's temperature. If this doesn't hold,
   refer to the differential definition of the heat capacity.
