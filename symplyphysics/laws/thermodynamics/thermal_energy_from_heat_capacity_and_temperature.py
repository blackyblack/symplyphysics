# Description
# Amount of energy for body heat Q = C * (t2 - t1)
# where:
# C - heat capacity
# t1 - initial temperature
# t2 - final temperature

# Note: heat capacity C is parameter indicates how much energy in joules
# must be expended to heat the substance by one unit temperature.

# Note: the resultant energy is the energy consumed for changing body temperature from value t1 to value t2
# Positive value Q is for absorbed energy (heating), negative for released energy (cooling)

# Note: most of the time, intensive heat capacity is known. Use [molar](../quantities/quantity_is_molar_quantity_times_amount_of_substance.py)
# and [specific](../quantities/quantity_is_specific_quantity_times_mass.py) laws for this.
