# Description
## The entropy of a system depends on the statistical weight of the state of the system.
## Statistical weight is the average number of microstates of a system that implement its macrostate.

## Law: S = k * ln(W), where
## S - entropy,
## k - boltzmann constant,
## W - statistical weight of state of the system.

# Derive the law from the properties of entropy

# Let us find entropy as a function of probability of the system's state, i.e. `S = f(P)`,
# where `S` is entropy, `P` is probability, and `f` is the functional dependency to be found.
# This dependency must be universal for all physical systems and should only depend on the system's
# probability.

# Suppose there are two independent subsystems in states with probabilities `P_1` and `P_2`
# respectively. If we join the two subsystems into one, the probability of the total system
# will be `P_12`, and using their independence we have `P_12 = P_1 * P_2`.
