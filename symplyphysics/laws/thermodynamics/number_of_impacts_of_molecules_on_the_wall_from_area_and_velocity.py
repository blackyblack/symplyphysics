Number of impacts on the wall from area and speed
=================================================

The number of impacts of molecules against the wall in a specified direction is
proportional to the number density of the molecules, the area of the wall, the
projection of velocity in said direction and time.

**Conditions:**

#. Gas is ideal.
#. Wall is flat and perpendicular to specified axis.

**Links:**
