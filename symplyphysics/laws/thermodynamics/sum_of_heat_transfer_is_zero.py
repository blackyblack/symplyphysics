# Description
## The first law of thermodynamics for a closed and adiabatically isolated
## system is called the heat balance equation: in a closed system of bodies,
## the algebraic sum of the amounts of heat given and received by all bodies
## involved in heat exchange is zero:
## sum(Q) = 0
## Where Q is amount of heat
