# Description
## The kinetic theory of ideal gases allows us to determine the average kinetic energy for an ideal gas.
## It states that the average kinetic energy for all ideal gases is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas and only depends on the temperature.

## Definition: E = 1.5 * k * T
## Where:
## E is average kinetic energy of molecules
## k is Boltzmann constant,
## T is temperature.

## Conditions
## The gas must be ideal
