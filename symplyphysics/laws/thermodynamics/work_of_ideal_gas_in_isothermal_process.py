Work of ideal gas in isothermal process
=======================================

The isothermal process of expansion (or compression) of a gas can occur under conditions where heat
exchange between the gas and the external environment is carried out at a constant temperature.
To do this, the heat capacity of the external environment must be large enough, and the expansion
(or compression) process must be slow enough.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`R` is the molar gas constant.

**Conditions:**

#. The temperature of the gas stays constant during the expansion.
