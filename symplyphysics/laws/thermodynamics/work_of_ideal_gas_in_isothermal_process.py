## Description
## The isothermal process of expansion (or compression) of a gas can occur under conditions where heat exchange between the gas and the external environment is carried out at a constant temperature difference.
## To do this, the heat capacity of the external environment must be large enough, and the expansion (or compression) process must be slow enough.

## Law: A = (m / mu) * R * T * ln(V_2 / V_1)
## Where:
## A is work of gas
## m is mass
## mu is molar mass
## V_1 is start volume
## V_2 is final volume
## R is ideal gas constant,
## T is temperature

## Note
## Since the internal energy of an ideal gas does not change during the isothermal process, all the heat received from the source is converted into work.
## When gas is compressed, the work of external forces is positive, and when expanding, the gas does the positive work.
