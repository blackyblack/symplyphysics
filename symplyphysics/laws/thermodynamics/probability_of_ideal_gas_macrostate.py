# Description
## Suppose there is a vessel of volume `V` with `N` identical ideal gas particles whose movement is described
## by classical mechanics. Let us divide the volume of the vessel into `m` small enough cells with volumes `V_1`
## upto `V_m`. Let us for a moment also attach a number to each gas particle to be able to tell them apart.

## The _microstate_ of the gas is the complete description of (a) the particle count of each cell of the vessel
## and (b) the particles of which numbers appear in each cell. A particle's moving within the same cell does not
## change the microstate of the gas, whereas a particle's moving from one cell to another constitutes the change
## of the microstate.

## The _macrostate_ of the gas only requires the description of the particle count in each cell of the vessel.
## If we assume the particles to be identical, it doesn't make a difference, from a macroscopic standpoint, particles
## of which number appear in which cells. Hence the probability of the macrostate is larger than that of the microstate
## by the factor of the number of permutations of the particles among the cells, which is exactly the statistical weight
## of the macrostate.

# Law: P = G * Product(p_i**N_i, i)
## P - probability of macrostate
## G - statistical weight of the macrostate
## p_i - probability of finding at least one particle in i-th cell
## N_i - number of particles in i-th cell

# Conditions
## - There are no external fields acting on the system
## - All particles are identical
## - Gas is ideal
## - Probabilities must sum up to 1
