# Description
## Fick's first law relates the diffusive flux to the gradient of the concentration. It postulates that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration,
## with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient (spatial derivative), or in simplistic terms the concept that a solute will move from a region of high concentration
## to a region of low concentration across a concentration gradient.
##The sign "-" in Fick's law indicates that the directions of the diffusion flow and the gradient are opposite: the gas diffuses towards a lower concentration, and the gradient is directed towards a higher concentration.

## Law: J = -D * dn / dx
## Where:
## J is the diffusion flux
## D is the diffusion coefficient
## n is the concentration, or amount of the substance per unit volume
## x is position

## Conditions
## Mixture is ideal
