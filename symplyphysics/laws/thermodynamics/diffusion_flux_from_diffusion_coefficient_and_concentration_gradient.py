Diffusion flux from diffusion coefficient and concentration gradient
====================================================================

*Fick's first law* relates the diffusion flux to the gradient of the concentration.
It postulates that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of
low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient
(spatial derivative), or, in simplistic terms, the concept that a solute will move from
a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across a concentration
gradient. The minus sign in the law indicates that the directions of the diffusion
flow and the gradient are opposite: the gas diffuses towards a lower concentration,
and the gradient is directed towards a higher concentration.

**Conditions:**

#. The mixture is ideal.
