# Description
## Also called the virial expansion, the virial equation of state expresses the compressibility factor
## (and therefore the pressure) of a real gas in local equilibrium as a power series of the density.

# Law: Z = 1 + B * rho + C * rho**2 + ...
## Z - [compressibility factor](../../../definitions/compressibility_factor_is_deviation_from_ideal_gas.py)
## B, C, ... - virial coefficients (technically they are functions of temperature)
## rho - molar density (amount of substance divided by volume)

# Note
## - The first virial coefficient A is defined as the constant of value 1 in order to enforce that the equation
##   reduces to the ideal gas equation as the gas density approaches zero.
## - N-th virial coefficient represents the non-additive n-body interactions of particles plus all
##   mutual interactions of 2 up to `n - 1` particles.
## - 4- and more body interactions are quite rare to happen, so the expansion is truncated to contain only
##   the second and third virial coefficients. Moreover, the latter have been extensively studied and tabulated
##   for many fluids.
