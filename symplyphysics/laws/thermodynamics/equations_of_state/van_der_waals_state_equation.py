# Description
# To more accurately describe the behavior of real gases at low temperatures,
# a Van der Waals gas model was created, taking into account the forces of intermolecular interaction.
# In this model, internal energy becomes a function not only of temperature, but also of volume.
#
# The Van der Waals equation is one of the well-known approximate equations of state describing
# the properties of a real gas, having a compact form and taking
# into account the main characteristics of a gas with intermolecular interaction.

# Law: (p + a * (nu / V)^2) * (V - b * nu) = nu * R * T
# Where:
## p - pressure
## T - temperature
## V - volume
## nu - amount of substance
## R - universal gas constant
## a - measure of the bonding forces between molecules,
## b is proportional to the volume of 1 mole of molecules.
