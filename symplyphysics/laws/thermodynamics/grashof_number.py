# Description
# The Grashof number (Gr) is a dimensionless number which the ratio of
# the buoyancy to viscous forces acting on a fluid. There is a characteristic
# length in the formula. The characteristic length is the dimension
# that defines the length scale of a physical system. A characteristic length
# is usually the volume of a system divided by its surface: L = V / A,
# where V is the volume of the body, and A is the cross-sectional area.
# For example, it is used to calculate flow through circular and non-circular
# tubes in order to examine flow conditions. D = 4 * A / p, where
# D is characteristic diameter, A is the cross-sectional are, p is wetted perimeter.
# Law: Gr = g * beta * (t_s - t_f) * L**3 / (nu ** 2), where
# g is gravitational acceleration,
# beta is coefficient of volume expansion,
# t_s is temperature of heat transfer surface,
# t_f is fluid temperature,
# L is characteristic length,
# nu is kinematic viscosity,
# Gr is Grashof number.
