**Euler relations**
===================

*Euler relations* are thermodynamic equations relating thermodynamic potentials with parameters
of the system such as pressure, volume, temperature, entropy, etc. They are also called *Euler
integrals* because they feature not differentials of thermodynamic potentials, but their integrated
forms. They are derived using `Euler's homogeneous function theorem
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function#Euler's_theorem>`_.
