"""
Wavelength of standing wave in string with fixed ends
=====================================================

If a standing wave occurs in a string with fixed ends, the value of the displacement
function :math:`q(x)` must be zero on both ends of the string. To satisfy this boundary
condition, only an integer number of half-waves can fit into the total length of the
string.

**Conditions:**

#. Boundary condition: :math:`q(0) = q(L) = 0`.

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave#Standing_wave_on_a_string_with_two_fixed_ends>`__.
