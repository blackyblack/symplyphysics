Position of antinodes in standing wave
======================================

In a standing wave, the locations of maximum amplitude are called antinodes. These locations are
not arbitrary, however, and are integer multiples of half the wavelength shifted by a quarter
of the wavelength.

**Notes:**

#. *Amplitude* refers to the absolute value of displacement from rest, therefore positions of
   maximum amplitude are such positions where the displacement is maximum or minimum .
