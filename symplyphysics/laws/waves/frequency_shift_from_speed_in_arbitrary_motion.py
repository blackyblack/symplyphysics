Frequency shift from speed in arbitrary motion
==============================================

The *Doppler effect* or *Doppler shift* is the apparent change in frequency of a wave in
relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source.

Also see :doc:`laws.waves.frequency_shift_from_speed_in_collinear_motion`.

**Conditions:**

#. The source and observer speeds are less or equal to the wave speed. Otherwise emitted
   waves are left behind the source or never reach the observer.
#. The speeds are much less than the speed of light, i.e. this law is non-relativistic.
