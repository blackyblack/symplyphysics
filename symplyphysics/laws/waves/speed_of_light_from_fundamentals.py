# Description
## Speed of light in vacuum is fundamental but still might be calculated from other fundamentals.

# Law: c = 1/sqrt(e0 * u0), where
## C is speed of light in vacuum,
## e0 is electric constant or vacuum permittivity,
## u0 is magnetic constant or vacuum permeability.


law = Eq(speed_of_light, 1 / sqrt(magnetic_constant * electric_constant))
