**Blackbody radiation**
=======================

Blackbody radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within, or surrounding,
a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, emitted by a black body, which
is an idealized opaque, non-reflective body. It has a specific, continuous spectrum of
wavelengths, inversely related to intensity, that depend only on the body's temperature,
which is assumed, for the sake of calculations and theory, to be uniform and constant.
