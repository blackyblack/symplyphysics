# Description
## Any object with non-zero absolute temperature radiates energy. Absolutely black object is objects, which doesn't reflect any radiation.
## Wavelength of most intesive radiation depends on object's temperature and is described by Wien's law.

# Law: lambda = b/T, where
## lambda is wavelength,
## T is thermodynamical temperature of object,
## b is Wien's constant, b = ch/ka, where c is speed of light, h is Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's constant and a = 4,965114.
