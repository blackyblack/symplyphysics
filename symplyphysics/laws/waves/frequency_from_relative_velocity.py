# Description
## Doppler effect is also applicable to electromagnetic waves in vacuum. As there is no any medium required for these waves to propagate,
## speed of source related to observer is used for the calculation of the Doppler effect.

# Law: fo = fs * sqrt((c - v)/(c + v)), where
## fo is observed frequency,
## fs is source wave frequency,
## v is velocity of source related to observer (positive velocity direction means source moving towards observer),
## c is speed of light.
