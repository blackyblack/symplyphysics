# Description
## Under the curved surface of the liquid, in addition to the internal pressure,
## additional pressure is created due to the curvature of the surface.
## For a bubble, this pressure is created by two surfaces: the outer and the inner.

## Law is: p = 4 * sigma / R, where
## p - excessive pressure under the curved surface of bubble,
## sigma - surface tension of the liquid,
## R - radius of bubble.
