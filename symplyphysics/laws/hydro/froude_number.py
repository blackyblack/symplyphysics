# Description
# Froude number characterizes the ratio between the force of inertia and
# the external force, in the field of which the motion occurs, acting on
# an elementary volume of liquid or gas. There is a characteristic length in
# the formula. The characteristic length is the dimension
# that defines the length scale of a physical system. A characteristic length
# is usually the volume of a system divided by its surface: L = V / A,
# where V is the volume of the body, and A is the cross-sectional area.
# For example, it is used to calculate flow through circular and non-circular
# tubes in order to examine flow conditions. D = 4 * A / p, where
# D is characteristic diameter, A is the cross-sectional are, p is wetted perimeter.
# Law: Fr = u / sqrt(g * L), where
# u is velocity,
# g is acceleration due to gravity,
# L is a characteristic length,
# Fr is Froude number.
