# Description
## Inner pressure of an ideal fluid is the sum of static, dynamic, and hydrostatic pressure at chosen point.

# Law: P_inner = P_static + P_dynamic + P_hydrostatic
## P_inner - inner pressure
## P_static - static pressure
## P_dynamic - dynamic pressure
## P_hydrostatic - hydrostatic pressure

# Condition: this definition applies to an ideal liquid, namely one that is
## 1) nonviscous
## 2) in steady (laminar) flow
## 3) incompressible
## 4) irrotational
