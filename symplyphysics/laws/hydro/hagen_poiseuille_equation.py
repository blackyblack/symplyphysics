Pressure difference at pipe ends from dynamic viscosity and flow rate
=====================================================================

In non-ideal fluid mechanics, the Hagenâ€”Poiseuille equation is a physical law that gives
the pressure drop in an incompressible and Newtonian fluid in laminar flow flowing
through a long cylindrical pipe of constant cross section. It can be successfully
applied to air flow in lung alveoli, or the flow through a drinking straw.

**Conditions:**

#. The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian.
#. The flow of the fluid is laminar.
#. The pipe is long enough for the flow to be laminar.
#. The pipe has constant cross section.

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia, first part of the first equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_equation#Equation>`__.
