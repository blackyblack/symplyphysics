# Description
## An element of flowing fluid will endure forces from the surrounding fluid (stress forces), that
## will gradually deform the element over time. In a steady (laminar) flow, these stress forces
## occur between fluid layers. For an incompressible and isotropic fluid, the shear stress exerted
## to an element of fluid is proportional to the spatial derivative of the velocity component
## that is perpendicular to the velocity vector (and as such, parallel to the direction of shear).
## This law is also called the Newton's law of viscosity, and the fluids that follow it are said to
## be Newtonian.

## As an example of this law, consider two solid flat plates that contain water in between.
## The bottom plate is fixed in place, while the top plate moves parallel to the bottom one with
## a small speed v (such that the flow of the water is steady). If we were to measure the force that
## needed to make the top plate continue to move, we would find that it is proportional to the area
## of the plate and the ratio v/d where d is the distance between the plates.

# Law: tau = eta * dv/dy
## tau - shear stress, i.e. the component of stress coplanar with a material cross section
## eta - dynamic viscosity
## v - speed of fluid flow
## d/dy - spatial derivative in the direction perpendicular to velocity vector
