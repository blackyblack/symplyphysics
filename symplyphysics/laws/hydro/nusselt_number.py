# Description
# Nusselt number is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer at
# a boundary in a fluid. There is a characteristic length in
# the formula. The characteristic length is the dimension
# that defines the length scale of a physical system. A characteristic length
# is usually the volume of a system divided by its surface: L = V / A,
# where V is the volume of the body, and A is the cross-sectional area.
# For example, it is used to calculate flow through circular and non-circular
# tubes in order to examine flow conditions. D = 4 * A / p, where
# D is characteristic diameter, A is the cross-sectional are, p is wetted perimeter.
# Law: Nu = h * L / k, where
# h is the heat transfer coefficient,
# L is the characteristic length,
# k is the thermal conductivity,
# Nu is Nusselt number.
