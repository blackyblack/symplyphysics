# Description
## Friction force is tangential interaction between two objects, which impedes there relative movement.
## It is proportional to pressure of one object to another.

## Law: Ffriction = mu * N
## Where:
## Ffriction is friction force,
## mu is friction factor for this pair of objects,
## N is normal reaction from one object to another.
