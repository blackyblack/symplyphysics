# Description
## A conservative force is a such a force, the total work of which in moving a particle
## between two points is independent of the path taken. Alternative definition states that
## if a particle travels in a closed loop, the total work done by a conservative force is zero.

## For every conservative force there exists a scalar field (potential), for which applies
## the following equality:

# Law: F = - grad U
## F - vector field of the conservative force
## U - scalar field of its potential
## grad - gradient operator

# Conditions
## - Force is conservative (see definition above)

def law(potential_: ScalarField) -> Vector:
    gradient_vector = gradient_operator(potential_)
    result_force_vector = scale_vector(-1, gradient_vector)
