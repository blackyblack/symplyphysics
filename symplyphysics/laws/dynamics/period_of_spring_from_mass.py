# Description
## Mass on spring is a system of object with mass m and spring with elasticity k. It starts oscillating after been pushed out of balance.

# Law: T = 2 * pi * sqrt(m/k)
# Where:
## T is period of oscillation,
## m is object mass,
## k is spring elastic coefficient.

# Conditions:
## - Spring doesn't accept or loose any energy. No any friction or inelastic deformations.
## - Object is small.
## - Another end of a spring is not moving in current coordinate system.
## - Spring is weightless.

## Spring displacement is distance between current and balanced positions.

## Spring oscillation is cyclic transfer of energy from kinetic to potential. To set oscillation up we have to input some energy. Usually it is done by biasing the spring and letting it go.
## Biasing the spring is giving to it some amount of potential energy.
