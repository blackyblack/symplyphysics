"""
Mechanical work is force times distance
=======================================

Work is measured result of force applied. Mechanical work is the only reason for the object energy to be changed.
Work is scalar value equal to force multiplied by distance.

**Conditions:**

#. The force and displacement vectors are collinear.

**Notes:**

#. Use the vector form of this law for non-collinear vectors of force and movement.
