# Description
## When a torque accelerates a rigid body in rotation about a fixed axis, the torque does work on
## the body. When the torque is constant, the work done on the body is proportional to torque
## and the angular displacement during the movement of the body.

# Law: W = tau * delta_theta
## W - work done
## tau - torque accelerating the body
## delta_theta - angular displacement of the body

# Derive law from non-rotational counterpart.
## We assume a particle moving along a curved trajectory due to a force F applied to it.
## Since only the component of the force vector which accelerates the particle does work on it,
## we are only interested in the tangent component of it.

# Conditions:
## The displacement of the particle should be small enough, so that the force, radius vector,
## and angle between the two stay the same at all points of the path in question.

# Reference frame:
## the x axis points in the direction of the radius vector
## the y axis is tangent to the part of the path in question
