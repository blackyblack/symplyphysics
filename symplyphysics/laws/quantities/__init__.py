Quantities
==========

Physical quantities can often be categorized as being either *extensive* or *intensive*, according to
how the property changes when the size or extent of the system changes.

**Intensive quantity**
    A quantity whose magnitude is independent of the size of the system.

**Extensive quantity**
    A quantity whose magnitude scales linearly with the size of the system,
    i.e. it is additive with respect to its subsystems.
