"""
Radius of curvature of charged particle in magnetic field
=========================================================

When a charged particle enters a magnetic field, it experiences an :doc:`electromagnetic
force <laws.electricity.vector.lorentz_force_via_electromagnetic_field>` upon itself.
In the absence of the electric field, the particle starts moving in a circular orbit. The
radius of curvature of the particle's orbit is determined by the mass, speed, and charge
of the particle as well as by the magnetic flux density.

**Conditions:**

#. The particle's speed and the magnetic field are perpendicular to each other.
#. The magnetic field is uniform.
#. The electric field is zero.
