**Microstrip lines**
====================

*Microstrip* is a type of electrical transmission line which can be fabricated with
any technology where a conductor is separated from a ground plane by a dielectric
layer known as "substrate". Microstrip lines are used to convey microwave-frequency signals.

By design, the microstrip line is a dielectric substrate on which a metal strip is
applied.

When a wave propagates along a microstrip line, part of the field goes out, since the
microstrip line does not have metal borders on all sides, unlike, for example,
rectangular waveguides.

Effective permittivity of microstrip line
-----------------------------------------

Imagine an environment in which the field will have the same magnitude as the field of a
microstrip line. The (relative) permittivity of such a medium will be called the
*effective (relative) permittivity* of the line. See image below.

Effective width of microstrip line
----------------------------------

*Effective width* of a microstrip line is the width of such a flat capacitor, the
electric intensity between the plates of which is equal to the electric intensity in the
dielectric of the substrate under the line strip.
