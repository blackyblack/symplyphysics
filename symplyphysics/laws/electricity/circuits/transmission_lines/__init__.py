**Transmission lines**
======================

A *transmission line* is a specialized cable or other structure designed to conduct
electromagnetic waves in a contained manner. The term applies when the conductors
are long enough that the wave nature of the transmission must be taken into account.

Transmission matrix
-------------------

The **transmission matrix** is one of the ways to describe a microwave device. The
:math:`ABCD`-parameters of the device act as elements of this matrix. The matrix
equation relates the input voltage and input current to the output voltage and output
current.

Scattering matrix
-----------------

The **scattering matrix** is one of the ways to describe a microwave device. The
:math:`S`-parameters of the device act as elements of this matrix. The matrix equation
relates the waves reflected from the input and output to the waves incident on the input
and output.
