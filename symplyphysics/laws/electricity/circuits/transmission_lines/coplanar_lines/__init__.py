**Coplanar lines**
==================

A *coplanar* transmission line is a type of transmission line where the signal strip and
ground planes are all located on the same side of the substrate. It is commonly used in
microwave devices and MMICs due to its better isolation compared to microstrip lines.

By design, the coplanar transmission line is a dielectric substrate on the surface of
which 3 electrodes are located:

When a wave propagates along a coplanar line, part of the field goes out, since the
coplanar line does not have metal borders on all sides, unlike, for example, rectangular
waveguides.

Effective permittivity of coplanar line
---------------------------------------

Imagine an environment in which the field will have the same magnitude as the field of a
coplanar line. The (relative) permittivity of such a medium will be called the
*effective (relative) permittivity* of the line.
