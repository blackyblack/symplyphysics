## Description
## The microstrip line is a dielectric substrate on which a metal strip is applied.
## The wave resistance of a transmission line is a value determined by the ratio of the voltage of the incident
## wave to the current of this wave in the transmission line.
## When a wave propagates along a microstrip line, part of the field goes out, since the microstrip line does
## not have metal borders on all sides, unlike, for example, rectangular waveguides. Then imagine an environment
## in which the field will have the same magnitude as the field of a microstrip line. The permittivity of such a
## medium will be called the effective permittivity of the line.
## The effective width of a microstrip line is the width of such a flat capacitor, the electric intensity between the plates
## of which is equal to the electric intensity in the dielectric of the substrate under the line strip.

## Law is: Z = 120 * pi * (Wef / h + 1.393 + 0.667 * ln(Wef / h + 1.444))**(-1) / sqrt(ef), where
## Z - wave resistance of the microstrip line,
## Wef - effective width of the microstrip line,
## h - thickness of substrate,
## ef - effective permittivity of the microstrip line.

# Conditions:
# - the effective width of the microstrip line should be greater than the thickness of the substrate.
