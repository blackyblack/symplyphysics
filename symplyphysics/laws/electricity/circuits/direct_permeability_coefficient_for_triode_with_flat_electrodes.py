# Description
## The coefficient of direct permeability of the grid characterizes its shielding effect and shows how much the electrostatic field of the anode is
## weaker than the grid field affects the cathode area.
## There is no general formula for this coefficient for an arbitrary electrode configuration, but there are formulas for special cases.
## One such case is a triode with flat electrodes.

## Law is: D = T * h / (x * d), where
## D - direct permeability coefficient of the grid,
## T - first tabular coefficient,
## h - grid step(distance between the grid wires),
## x - distance from anode to grid,
## d - second tabular coefficient.
