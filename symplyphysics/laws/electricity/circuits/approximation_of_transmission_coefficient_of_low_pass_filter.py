# Description
## The approximation of the power transmission coefficient of a normalized low-pass filter is given by approximating functions of the order of n.
## Bandwidth distortion determines the maximum distortion in the bandwidth. In other words, to determine the level of ripples in the bandwidth.

# Law: H = 1 / (1 + e^2 * Fn(w)^2)
## Where:
## H - the transfer coefficient of the filter,
## e - bandwidth distortion,
## Fn(w) - approximating function of the order of n of the transfer coefficient,
## w - frequency.
