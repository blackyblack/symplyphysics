# Description
## The approximation of the power transmission coefficient of a normalized low-pass filter is given by approximating functions of the order of n.
## Bandwidth distortion determines the maximum distortion in the bandwidth. In other words, to determine the level of ripples in the bandwidth.
## The band-stop distortion sets the required suppression level in the filter band-stop.

# Law: F(fs, n) = es / ep
## Where:
## F(f, n) - approximating function of the order of n,
## es - band-stop distortion,
## ep - bandwidth distortion,
## fs - frequency of the band-stop.
