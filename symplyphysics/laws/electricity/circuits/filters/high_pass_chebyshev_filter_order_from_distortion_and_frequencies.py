High pass Chebyshev filter from distortion and frequency
========================================================

The approximation of the power transmission coefficient of a normalized high-pass filter
is given by approximating functions of order :math:`n`. The **Chebyshev filter** is
described by the function :math:`\\left(\\cos{n \\arccos{f^{-1}}}\\right)^{-1}` of
frequency :math:`f`. In this case, a high-pass filter is considered. The high-pass
filter removes all frequencies from :math:`0` to the set frequency.
