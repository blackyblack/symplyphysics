# Description
## The approximation of the power transmission coefficient of a normalized low-pass filter is given by approximating functions of the order of n.
## The Butterworth filter is described by the function frequency^n.
## Bandwidth distortion determines the maximum distortion in the bandwidth. In other words, to determine the level of ripples in the bandwidth.
## The band-stop distortion sets the required suppression level in the filter band-stop.
## You can only implement an integer-order filter. And the formula itself returns the minimum order of the filter, which will have the
## specified parameters (frequencies and distortions). Therefore, you need to round it up (use ceil()).

## Law is: N = ln(es / ep) / ln(fs / fp), where
## N - Butterworth filter order,
## es - band-stop distortion,
## ep - bandwidth distortion,
## fs - frequency of the band-stop (the frequency that corresponds to the maximum band-stop distortion),
## fp - cutoff frequency (the frequency that corresponds to the maximum bandwidth distortion).
