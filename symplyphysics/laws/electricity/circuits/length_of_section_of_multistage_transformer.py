# Description
## A multistage resistance transformer consists of several sections. The length of each section depends on the wavelength at
## the upper operating frequency and the wavelength at the lower operating frequency.

## Law is: L = L1 * L2 / (2 * (L1 + L2)), where
## L - length of section,
## L1 - the wavelength at the upper frequency,
## L2 - the wavelength at the lower frequency.

wavelength_for_upper_frequency = Symbol("wavelength_for_upper_frequency", units.length)
wavelength_for_lower_frequency = Symbol("wavelength_for_lower_frequency", units.length)
