**Waveguides**
==============

A *waveguide* is a structure that guides waves by restricting the transmission of energy
to one direction. Common types of waveguides include acoustic waveguides which direct
sound, optical waveguides which direct light, and radio-frequency waveguides which direct
electromagnetic waves other than light like radio waves.

.. _critical_wavelength_waveguide_def:

**Critical wavelength of waveguide**

The **critical wavelength** of a waveguide is such that signals with a wavelength
greater than the critical one become attenuated and do not propagate in the waveguide.
