**Waveguides*
=========================

A *waveguide* is a structure that guides waves by restricting the transmission of energy
to one direction. Common types of waveguides include acoustic waveguides which direct
sound, optical waveguides which direct light, and radio-frequency waveguides which direct
electromagnetic waves other than light like radio waves.
