# Description
## The basic characteristic of a coil is its inductance - the ability of the coil to accumulate energy as magnetic field.
## Law: L = mu * mu_0 * N**2 * S / d, where
## L is the inductance of a coil,
## mu is magnetic permeability of core,
## mu_0 is magnetic constant (magnetic permeability of vacuum),
## N is number of turns,
## S is area of each turn (coil's cross sectional area),
## d is coil length.
