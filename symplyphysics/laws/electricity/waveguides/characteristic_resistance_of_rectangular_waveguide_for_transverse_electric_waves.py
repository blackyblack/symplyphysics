## Description
## A rectangular waveguide is a rectangular metal waveguide capable of supporting waves propagating along it.
## There is a critical wavelength. Signals with a wavelength greater than the critical one are attenuated and
## do not propagate in the waveguide.
## The characteristic resistance of a wave is a value determined by the ratio of the transverse component
## of the electric field strength to the transverse component of the magnetic field strength of a traveling wave.
## Transverse electric waves are waves in which the electric field has no longitudinal component.

## Law is: Z = Z0 / sqrt(1 - (L / L1)^2), where
## Z - characteristic resistance of rectangular waveguide,
## Z0 - characteristic resistance of the material filling the waveguide,
## L - wavelength,
## L1 - critical wavelength.

# Conditions:
# - waves propagating in the waveguide must be transverse electric waves.
