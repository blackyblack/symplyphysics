## Description
## The coplanar transmission line is a dielectric substrate on the surface of which 3 electrodes are located.
## When a wave propagates along a coplanar line, part of the field goes out, since the coplanar line does
## not have metal borders on all sides, unlike, for example, rectangular waveguides. Then imagine an environment
## in which the field will have the same magnitude as the field of a coplanar line. The permittivity of such a
## medium will be called the effective permittivity of the line.

## Law is: ef = 1 + er / 2, where
## ef - effective permittivity of the coplanar line,
## er - relative permittivity of the dielectric substrate of the coplanar line.

# Conditions:
# h - thickness of substrate,
# b - distance between the extreme electrodes.
# - h >= b / 4.
