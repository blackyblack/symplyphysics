Force between parallel wires
============================

Two parallel wires through which current flows interact with each other. The intensity
of their interaction depends on the magnitude of the current, the distance from the
wires, as well as on the material and length of the wire.

**Notation:**

#. :quantity_notation:`vacuum_permeability`.

**Notes:**

#. Also see `Amp√®re's force law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_force_law>`__.
