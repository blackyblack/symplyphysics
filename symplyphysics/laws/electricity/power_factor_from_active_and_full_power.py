# Description
## Power factor is property of any AC consumer. Commonly not all power consumed from source makes useful work.
## The part of consumed power which makes work called active power.
## Part of it may be returned to source and it is also known as reactive power.
## Law: Q = P / S, where
## Q is power factor,
## P is active power consumed,
## S is total power consumed.
