Electric field due to point charge
==================================

The strength of the electric field set up by a point charge is linearly proportional
to the value of the charge and the square inverse of the distance to it.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\varepsilon_0` (:code:`epsilon_0`) is vacuum permittivity.
