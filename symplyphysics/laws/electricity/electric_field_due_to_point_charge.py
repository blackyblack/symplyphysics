# Description
## The value of the electric field set up by a point charge is linearly proportional 
## to the value of the charge and the square inverse of the distance to it.

# Law: E = k_e * q / r^2
## E - value of the electric field, which has the same sign as the charge producing it
## k_e - Coulomb's constant
## q - point charge
## r - distance to point charge
