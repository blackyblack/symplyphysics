# Description
## A magnetic field intensity is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric
## charges, electric currents and magnetic materials. In the case of an infinite wire, the magnetic
## field intensity depends only on the current and the distance from the wire.

## Law is: H = I / (2 * pi * r), where
## H - magnetic field intensity,
## I - current,
## r - distance from the wire.
