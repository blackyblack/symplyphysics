# Description
## Coulomb's law states that the force F between two point charges, q1 and q2, in a vacuum is proportional to their product
## and inversely proportional to the square of their distance apart r.

# Law: F = k_e * ((q_1 * q_2)/r_{12}^2), where
## F is force between two electrically charged particles at rest (in vacuum),
## k_e is a Coulomb constant,
## q_1 and q_2 are the quantities of each charge,
## r is the distance between the charges.

# Note
## The symbols Q1 and Q2 in the Coulomb's law equation represent the quantities of charge on the two interacting objects.
## When using the "+" and "-" signs in the calculation of force,
## the result will be that a "-" value for force is a sign of an attractive force
## and a "+" value for force signifies a repulsive force. Mathematically, the force value
## would be found to be positive when Q1 and Q2 are of like charge - either both "+" or both "-".
## And the force value would be found to be negative when Q1 and Q2 are of opposite charge - one is "+"
## and the other is "-". This is consistent with the concept that oppositely charged objects
## have an attractive interaction and like charged objects have a repulsive interaction.
