# Description
## The potential of the electrostatic field φ at a given point is a scalar value equal to the ratio
## of the potential energy W of a charge q placed at a given point to the value of this charge.
## The unit of measurement of potential is – Volt (V). A volt is equal to the potential of the field point
## at which a charge of 1 Coulomb has a potential energy of 1 Joule.

## Law is: φ = q / (4 * pi * e0 * e * r), where
## φ - potential of electrostatic field,
## q - charge,
## e0 - electric constant,
## e - electric relative permittivity,
## r - distance from point charge.
