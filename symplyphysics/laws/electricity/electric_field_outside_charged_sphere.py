"""
Electric field outside charged sphere
=====================================

The electric field outside of a charged sphere behaves as is the sphere were a point charge,
i.e. its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the center
of the sphere. However, due to the Gauss's law, on the inside the electric field is exactly zero.

**Notation:**

#. :quantity_notation:`vacuum_permittivity`.

**Conditions:**

#. The sphere is thin, i.e. its thickness approaches zero.
