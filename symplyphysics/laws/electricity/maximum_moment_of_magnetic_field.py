# Description
## The magnetic moment is the main physical quantity characterizing the magnetic properties of a substance,
## that is, the ability to create and perceive a magnetic field.

## Law is: m = I * S, where
## m - magnetic moment,
## I - current,
## S - area of closed contour, which is formed by a closed thin conductor through which current flows.

# Conditions:
## - Ideally, the conductor itself should be infinitely thin. But a conductor can have
##   any shape and size if its dimensions can be neglected relative to the size of the
##   closed circuit that it forms.
## - The plane must be flat for this formula to be applicable. If there are several turns
##   of the conductor, then the formula will be similar, but still different.
