Magnetic moment via current and contour area
============================================

The **magnetic moment** is the main physical quantity characterizing the magnetic
properties of a substance, that is, the ability to create and perceive a magnetic
field.

**Conditions:**

#. Ideally, the conductor itself should be infinitely thin. But a conductor can have
   any shape and size if its dimensions can be neglected relative to the size of the
   closed circuit that it forms.

#. The plane must be flat for this formula to be applicable, and the current must
   only make one turn around the contour.

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment#Amp%C3%A8rian_loop_model>`__.
