# Description
## Lorentz force is force acting on a charge moving at speed from magnetic field.
## Lorentz force depends on the magnitude of charge, its velocity, magnitude of magnetic induction
## and angle between the magnetic induction and the charge velocity.
## The force is directed perpendicular to the plane in which the velocity and magnetic induction vectors are located.

## Law is: F = q * v * B * sin(a), where
## F - force,
## q - charge,
## v - velocity of charge,
## B - induction,
## a - angle between induction and velocity.
