# Description
## The value of the electric field set up by a dipole at a distant point on the dipole axis 
## (which runs through both particles) is proportional to the inverse cube of the distance 
## to the dipole and the value of the dipole moment.

# Law:
## E = 2 * k_e * p / z^3
## E - value of electric field of dipole
## k_e - Coulomb's constant
## p = ql - value of the dipole moment
## z - distance to dipole on the dipole axis

# Condition
## z/l >> 1 - the point of measuring the electric field should be far enough from the dipole itself

# the negative charge located below and the positive one above the origin.
