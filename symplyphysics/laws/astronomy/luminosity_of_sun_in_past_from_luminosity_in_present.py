# Description
## The luminosity of the Sun in the past is related to the luminosity of the Sun in the present. Luminosity is
## indicated in units of solar luminosity. One unit is equal to the luminosity of the Sun at a given time.
## There are two different formulas to calculate luminosity in the past and in the future. It is because it is
## non linear and requires different approximations for past and future.

## Law is: Lpast = L / (1 + 0.4 * (1 - (t / 4.6))), where
## Lpast - luminosity of the sun in past,
## L - luminosity of the sun in present,
## t - time in billions of years.
