# Description
## A gravitational maneuver is a purposeful change in the trajectory and flight speed of a spacecraft under the influence
## of the gravitational fields of celestial bodies.
## The maximum angle of rotation of the rocket during a gravitational maneuver depends on the first cosmic velocity of
## the planet around which the maneuver is performed, and the speed of the rocket relative to this planet.
## Law describes the closest possible maneuver, when aiming range is at planet radius.

## Law is: phi = arctg((v1 / v2)^2), where
## phi - maximum angle of rotation during a gravitational maneuver (angle at which the velocity vector of the rocket rotates),
## v1 - first cosmic velocity for a given planet,
## v2 - rocket's velocity relative to the planet.

# Conditions:
# - Aiming range equals to planet radius.
