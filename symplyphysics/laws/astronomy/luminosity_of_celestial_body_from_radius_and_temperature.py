# Description
## Luminosity is an absolute measure of radiated electromagnetic energy (light) per unit time, and is synonymous with the radiant power emitted by a light-emitting object.
## In astronomy, luminosity is the total amount of electromagnetic energy emitted per unit of time by a star, galaxy, or other astronomical objects.

# Law: L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4

## L is luminosity
## sigma is constant of proportionality, called the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann constant,
## R is the radius of the star
## T is the temperature of the star's photosphere
