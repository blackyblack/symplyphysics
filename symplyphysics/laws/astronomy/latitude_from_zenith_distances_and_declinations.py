# Description
## Knowing the zenith distances and declinations of the northern and southern stars, respectively, it is possible
## to determine the latitude of the observation site.
## Northern star is any star north of the zenith with known declination.
## Southern star is any star south of the zenith with known declination.

## Law is: phi = (zs - zn + ds + dn) / 2, where
## phi - latitude,
## zs - zenith distance for the north star,
## zn - zenith distance for the south star,
## ds - declination for the north star,
## dn - declination for the south star.

# Conditions:
# - both stars are at upper transit (culmination).
