# Description
## The main sequence is the stage of stellar evolution.
## This stage begins in stars after the protostar stage. At the beginning of the main sequence stage, the age of the star
## is considered to be zero.
## The indicator is 4.75 for stars with a mass of 0.7 - 2 solar masses and is equal to 4.75 * M + 2.125 for stars with a mass
## of 0.1 â€“ 0.7 solar masses.

## Law is: T = 10 * M^(1 - n), where
## T - lifetime on the main sequence in billions of years,
## M - mass of the star (in masses of the Sun),
## n - indicator depending on the mass of the star.
