# Description
## If two monochromatic waves of the same frequency are combined in the Young scheme,
## then for the case when d << L and x << L (L - distance from slits to surface with image,
## x - coordinate from symmetry point, d - distance), it is possible to approximate:

# Law: delta = x * d / l
# Where:
## delta - optical travel difference for two coherent waves
## x - coordinate in interference picture, measured from the center of symmetry
## d - distance between slits (or source parameter)
## l - distance from slits to picture

# Conditions:
# - Two monochromatic waves of the same frequency;
# - d << L and x << L;
# - The slits should be positioned symmetrically relative to the axis passing
#   through the radiation source, while this axis of symmetry should be perpendicular
#   to the plane on which the interference pattern will be.
