# Description
## Newton's rings are annular interference maxima and minima that appear around the point of contact between
## a convex lens and a planeâ€”parallel plate when light passes through the lens and plate.
## The order of interference indicates the number of whole wavelengths. When the difference in the path of the
## beam reflected from the convex surface of the lens at the glass-air boundary and the beam reflected from the
## plate at the air-glass boundary is equal to an entire wave "n", then these two waves hit the observation
## point with the same faces and demonstrate interference.

## Law is: r = sqrt(k * R * L / n), where
## r - radius of dark Newton's ring,
## k - order of ring,
## R - radius of curvature of lens
## L - wavelength in a vacuum,
## n - refractive index of medium between lens and plate.
