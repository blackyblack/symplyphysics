# Description
## Magnification, in optics, the size of an image relative to the size of the object creating it.
## Linear (sometimes called lateral or transverse) magnification refers to the ratio of image length to object length measured in planes that are perpendicular to the optical axis.

## Law: M = h_image / h_object
## Where:
## M is linear magnification produced by lense
## h_image is height of the image
## h_object is height of the object

## Conditions
## If the image is straight, then the value h_image is considered with a plus sign, and if it is inverted, then with a minus sign.
