# Description
## Magnification, in optics, the size of an image relative to the size of the object creating it.
## Depending on the position of the object in relation to the lens, the linear dimensions of the image change.
## If magnfication is positive, it means image formed is virtual and erect.
## If magnfication is negative, it means image formed is real and inverted.

## Law: M = f / d
## Where:
## M is linear magnification produced by lense
## f is distance from lens to image
## d is distance from lens to object

## Conditions
## If virtual image is formed, f is negative.
## If real image is formed, f is positive.
## d is always negative as object is on left side of the lens.
