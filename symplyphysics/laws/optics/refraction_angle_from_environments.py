# Description
## If ray of light comes from one medium to another, it refracts.
## Incoming ray, refracted ray and perpendicular to medium boundary are within the same plane.

## Law: n1 * sin(alpha) = n2 * sin(beta)
## Where:
## n1 is refractive index of first medium.
## n2 is refractive index of second medium.
## alfa is incoming angle. Angle is measured between normal vector to a medium boundary plane directed outside of refracting medium and incoming ray of light.
## beta is refraction angle. Angle is measured between normal vector to a medium boundary plane directed inside refracting medium and refracted ray of light.

# Conditions
## - alfa is in [-pi/2, pi/2] range, meaning that incoming ray comes from the outer medium.
## - beta is in [-pi/2, pi/2] range, meaning that refracted ray stays in the refracting medium.
## - light is monochromic, as refactive index depends on the light frequency.
## - refracting medium is uniform, so refracting index does not change over ray path.
