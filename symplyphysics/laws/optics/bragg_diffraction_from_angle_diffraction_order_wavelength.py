Bragg diffraction from angle of diffraction and wavelength
==========================================================

Diffraction from a three-dimensional periodic structure such as atoms in a crystal is called Bragg's
diffraction. This is similar to what happens when waves are scattered on a diffraction grating. Bragg's
diffraction is a consequence of interference between waves reflected from crystal planes.

**Conditions:**

#. The scattering of light on the atomic planes is specular (mirror-like).
#. The incident and scattered light and the light inside the crystal have the same wavelength.

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg%27s_law#Bragg_condition>`__.
