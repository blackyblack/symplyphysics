Neutron flux for uniform cylinder
=================================

Neutron flux for the uniform cylindrical reactor of radius :math:`r_0` and height
:math:`h_0` depends on the radial distance :math:`r` and axial coordinate :math:`z`. A
cylindrical coordinate system is assumed, such that the cylinder's axis of rotation is
the :math:`z`-axis.

# Neutron flux is a function of radius and height in the cylindrical coordinates.

# - vacuum boundary condition: Ф(R + d) = Ф(Re) = Ф(a + d) = Ф(ae) = 0
# - finite flux condition: 0 <= Ф(r, x) < ∞
# - interface condition: the neutron flux and the normal component of the neutron current must be continuous
