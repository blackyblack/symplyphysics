# Description
## Half-life is the time required for a quantity (of substance) to reduce to half of its initial value.
## The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo radioactive
## decay or how long stable atoms survive. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type
## of exponential (or, rarely, non-exponential) decay.

## Law is: N = N0 * 2^(-t / T), where
## N - number of cores after a period of time,
## N0 - initial number of cores,
## t - an arbitrary time interval,
## T - half-life of the nuclei.
