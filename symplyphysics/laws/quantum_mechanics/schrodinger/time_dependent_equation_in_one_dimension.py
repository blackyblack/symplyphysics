# Description
## The Schr√∂dinger equation is a linear partial differential equation that governs the wave
## function of a quantum-mechanical system. This law describes the general case of a time-dependent
## potential and a time-dependent wave function.

# Notes
## - This law works in the case of 1 spatial dimension. To use it for the 3-dimensional space
##   replace the spatial second derivative with the Laplace operator.
