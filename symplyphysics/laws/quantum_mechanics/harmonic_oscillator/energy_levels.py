# Description
## As opposed to the classical harmonic oscillator, the energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator
## are quantized, meaning that its energy take a value out of a discrete range. These energy levels
## are equidistant, i.e. the difference between successive energy levels is the same for all levels.

# Law: E_n = (n + 1/2) * hbar * omega
## E_n - energy of n-th level
## n - quantum number of oscillator, which is any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...)
## hbar - reduced Planck constant
## omega - angular frequency of oscillator

# Notes
## - This means that the energy of a quantum oscillator cannot be zero and the lowest it can be
##   is the zero-point energy `E_0 = hbar * omega / 2`.
