# Description
## Parallel LC circuit might be an object for resonance effect.
## Total LC impedance depends on frequency of supplied energy.
## Impedance has a single peak at the frequency corresponding to Thompson's frequency of this LC.
## This is a resonant frequency of this circuit.
## Also we have here a real LC with some resistive leakage. Resonant frequency stays the same as ideal LC, but resonant peak is not so sharp. The sharpness of resonant peak shows quality factor of LC circuit.
