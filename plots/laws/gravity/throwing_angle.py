## Choose coordinates: object starts its flight from (0, 0), vertical axis is upwards, horisontal axis is toward object's destination.
## So the angle between X-axis and initial speed is throwing_angle, and the angle between Y-axis and gravitational acceleration is pi / 2 - throwing_angle.
## Both X and Y projections of movement are constant acceleration movements. 
## The vertical initial speed is projection of throwing_velocity to Y, acceleration is projection of gravitational acceleration to Y and it is -g.
## The horizontal initial speed is projection of throwing_velocity to X, acceleration is 0.
## Flight ends when y == 0 again.
